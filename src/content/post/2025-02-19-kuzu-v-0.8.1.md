We are excited to announce the second release: v0.8.1 of kuzu in 2025. This release brings a new extension: Unity Catalog, which allows you to scan/copy from Delta Lake tables managed by Unity Catalog.

In addition to the new extension, we also improved our existing extensions by introducing new features:
- Support for scanning/copying from/writing to files hosted on [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)(GCS) filesystem.
- Support for customizing the stopwords table used in full-text search.

To prevent accidental leakage of sensitive data, our CLI explicitly excludes confidential information such as `S3 access keys` from being stored in the command history file, ensuring your credentials remain secure.

Finally, we’ve significantly improved our execution of distinct aggregation queries via a new parallel distinct hash aggregation mechanism.
In the following sections, we dive into details.

## New Features

### Unity Catalog Extension
We're introducing an experimental `unity_catalog` extension to enable scanning/copying from Delta Lake tables managed by [Unity Catalog](https://www.unitycatalog.io/]).
A quickstart guide on how to setup a local unity catalog server can be found: [there](https://docs.unitycatalog.io/quickstart)

To attach a unity catalog, you have to first install and load the unity_catalog extension:
```
INSTALL unity_catalog;
LOAD EXTENSION unity_catalog;
```
Similar to attach to a relational database, unity catalog can be attached using the `ATTACH` statement. The example below attaches to the catalog named `unity`:
```
ATTACH 'unity' AS unity (dbtype uc_catalog)
```
Once the `unity` catalog is attached, you can scan from delta tables hosted by the `unity` catalog under the `default` schema as follow:
```sql
# Scan the numbers table
LOAD FROM unity.default.numbers
RETURN *
```

One important use case of the Unity Catalog extension is to facilitate seamless data transfer from tables in Unity Catalog to Kùzu.
```sql
# Migrate data from the unity.default.numbers table to the `numbers` table in Kùzu
CREATE NODE TABLE numbers (id INT32, score DOUBLE , PRIMARY KEY(id));
COPY numbers FROM unity.numbers;
```

### GCS FileSystem Support
Our `httpfs` extension now supports working with files on [Google Cloud Storage(GCS)](https://cloud.google.com/storage). Any operation that we supported with Amazon S3 will now work with GCS. This includes:
- [Scanning (`COPY/LOAD FROM`) from files hosted on GCS](//docs.kuzudb.com/extensions/httpfs#reading-from-gcs)
- [Writing to (`COPY TO`) files hosted on GCS](//docs.kuzudb.com/extensions/httpfs#uploading-to-gcs)
- [Attaching to a read-only kuzu database hosted on GCS](//docs.kuzudb.com/extensions/attach/kuzu)

To work with GCS, you must configure kuzu to use your `GCS HMAC keys`(https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/hmackeys):

```sql
CALL gcs_access_key_id='${GCS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}';
CALL gcs_secret_access_key='${GCS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}'
```

After configuring your credentials, you can access files on GCS by using urls in the format `gcs://${BUCKET_NAME}/${PATH_TO_FILE_IN_BUCKET}`:

```sql
LOAD FROM 'gs://kuzudb-test/user.csv' return *; // scan from GCS
COPY (MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p) TO 'gcs://kuzudb-test/person.csv' (header=true); // upload to GCS
ATTACH 'gcs://kuzudb-test/tinysnb/' as tinysnb (dbtype kuzu); // attach remote DB in GCS
```

### Stopwords customization in Full-text Search (FTS)
Stopwords in Full-Text Search (FTS) are commonly occurring words that are excluded from indexing and query processing to improve efficiency and relevance. Words like "the," "and," "is," or "in" (language-specific), which are deemed non-essential for search relevance, are typically used as stopwords by retrieval systems. Kùzu uses a pre-defined list of english stopwords by default, however it is common for users to customize their own stopwords list based on their use cases. Customized stopwords can be given as an optional parameter when a full-text search index is built as follow:
```sql
CALL CREATE_FTS_INDEX(
    'Book',   // Table name
    'book_index',   // Index name
    ['abstract', 'title'],   // Properties to build FTS index on
    stemmer := 'porter',   // Stemmer to use (optional)
    stopwords := 'https://stopwords/porter.csv' // Configure customized stopwords list (optional)
); 
```

The `stopwords` parameter can either be:
1. A file path to a single string column `CSV`/`PARQUET` file with each stopword on a separate line.
2. A node table with a single string column with each stopword on a separate row.
