When it comes to building RAG applications, I've long held the belief that knowledge graphs and vector search go hand-in-hand.
However, anyone who has experimented with Text2Cypher in Graph RAG is likely familiar (as I am) with a common frustration:
the `MATCH` query returns an empty result (most likely because there isn't an exact match for the property value in
the database). This stalls the retrieval step, and the LLM cannot generate a response.

In this post, I'll demonstrate how to address this limitation by enhancing retrieval with Kuzu’s vector search capabilities,
introducing an agentic router that leverages tool calling to handle empty results more intelligently. I'll
pay special attention towards testing and evaluating the agent workflow vs. the vanilla Graph RAG workflow, to show that
the performance is indeed improved by the agentic approach.

In an [earlier post](/post/unstructured-data-to-graph-baml-kuzu/), I demonstrated a methodology to transform
unstructured data (images and/or text) from multiple sources into a graph using [BAML](https://www.boundaryml.com/) and Kuzu.
This post picks up from where I left off, by reusing the existing graph of patients, the drugs they take,
the conditions the drugs treat, and the side effects (symptoms) experienced by the patients taking these drugs.
The schema of this graph is shown below.

#### TL;DR: The key takeaways are:
 
- **Not 0 to 1**: Real world agentic systems exhibit a spectrum of autonomy (the degree of autonomy in the
system is not binary). These systems are typically a combination of autonomous agentic components driven by LLMs,
and deterministic components that involve hardcoded logic.
- **Agents 🤝🏽 Graph RAG**: Graph RAG is an inherently agentic problem, because the system needs to be able to recover from
incorrect Cypher queries or retrieval failures at various stages.
- **Text2Cypher capabilities**: Recent LLMs from popular commercial providers, for e.g., `openai/gpt-4.1` and `google/gemini-2.0-flash`, are quite
capable at translating natural language questions into valid Cypher queries by inspecting the given graph schema.
- **Performance**: Graph RAG performance can be significantly enhanced by using a simple tool-calling router agent that can leverage
vector search alongside graph queries.
- **Evaluation is key**: It's a good idea to _incrementally_ add autonomy to the Graph RAG workflow while regularly evaluating the outcome on an _end-to-end_ basis.
This inspires more trust in the system across a wide range of user inputs, while also allowing for future upgrades as LLMs get better over time.

## A quick primer on agents

Just like Graph RAG itself, the term "agentic" can mean different things to different people, so let's qualify
our definition before using it liberally in the rest of this post. Based on information
from multiple reputable sources[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3], the consensus on what makes a workflow
"agentic" is that it involves **LLMs making decisions** about the control flow at one or more stages.
This is in contrast to the purely deterministic workflows you may be used to from software engineering,
where the control flow is explicitly defined by hand.

> An agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application.[^4]

The key point to remember is that there exists a _continuous spectrum of autonomy_ in which an agentic
system can operate -- it's not "all or nothing" when it comes to the degree of control in the hands of the LLM!
Any real-world workflow typically consists of multiple stages, not all of which can, and should, be handled
by an LLM. To help guide the system towards the desired outcome, interspersing LLM-driven stages with
deterministic steps (simple `while` loops, `if` statements, etc. in code) is a good way to go.

In general, LLMs can make decisions on an application's control flow in various ways:

- Route to one of many tools or tasks downstream, depending on the output of a previous stage
- Inspect the output from a previous stage and decide if it's sufficient. If more work is
needed: a) run it again in a loop, or b) pass the work to other LLM-enabled agents downstream.

The level of autonomy of an agentic workflow can be succinctly summarized by the following figure.[^4]

<Img src="/img/enhancing-graph-rag-with-vector-search/agent-rag-1.png" alt="Graph schema of the patient-drug graph" />

At the lower end of the scale, the LLM is used to route the control flow to upstream/downstream
components that may be fully deterministic in and of themselves. At the upper end of
the scale (fully autonomous), an LLM can pass control to other LLM-enabled agents, making the entire workflow non-deterministic.
In practice, real-world agentic systems tend to be a combination of autonomous components on either end of this scale
(or somewhere in between), with deterministic components at intermediate stages that impose adequate checks, balances
and guardrails to guide the system towards the desired outcome.

## Why Graph RAG is inherently agentic

Per the definition from [prior posts](/post/llms-in-each-stage-of-a-graph-rag-chatbot) in this blog, Graph RAG is a form of RAG where the retrieval
step depends on a knowledge graph, providing the answer-generation LLM relevant context based on factual
information in the graph -- this is in contrast to retrieving the "most semantically similar"
text based on embeddings of unstructured data in vector-based RAG.

To retrieve from a graph database in a generalizable manner, a
"Text2Cypher" LLM inspects the user query and the graph schema, translating them into a Cypher query that can
retrieve from the graph. The results from this query are then appropriately formatted and passed as
context to an answer-generation LLM, which can formulate a response in natural language. An example of this
(when it works as intended) is shown below.

<Img src="/img/enhancing-graph-rag-with-vector-search/rag-text2cypher-1.png" alt="Text2Cypher methodology in Graph RAG" />

Vanilla Graph RAG, based on Text2Cypher alone, has an important limitation: even if the Cypher query
generated is syntactically correct, if there isn't an _exact_ `MATCH` for the value specified in the query,
it will return an empty result. In the example below, the question is asking for drugs that have the side effect
"sleepiness", but the database has nodes with the side effect "drowsiness", resulting in an empty result from the Cypher query
because no exact match is found. Not ideal by any means.

<Img src="/img/enhancing-graph-rag-with-vector-search/rag-text2cypher-2.png" alt="When Text2Cypher doesn't work in Graph RAG!" />

Naively running a single pass of Text2Cypher can quite often fail to return a useful response from
the graph query. This is why vector search (based on semantic similarity)
is a core component of most RAG systems. Because "drowsiness" and "sleepiness" essentially mean the same thing,
we'd want our RAG system to try again, looking for similar symptoms experienced by patients or caused by drugs.
Importantly, the retry logic may not easily be determined beforehand by a human, because the choice of downstream action
can depend on the user query and the output from the prior step. This is why Graph RAG is inherently agentic:
the retrieval process can benefit from the reasoning capabilities of LLMs at various stages to improve the outcome.

In the sections below, I'll show how to expose Kuzu's vector index function as a
tool that an LLM can call as a fallback, in case an initial attempt at Text2Cypher returns an empty response. These
are the beginnings of an _agentic Graph RAG_ pipeline, where an LLM decides what tools to call to improve the results. Rather
than aiming for fully autonomous agents right off the bat, the goal is to _incrementally_ add more autonomy to the system,
starting with a routing-based approach, and testing it end-to-end to see if the performance indeed improves.

## Create a vector index

Kuzu provides a performant, on-disk HNSW index via a [vector extension](https://docs.kuzudb.com/extensions/vector/)
that scales as your data grows in size. You simply store vector embeddings (which are basically
floating point arrays of a fixed dimensionality) as properties on your node tables. In this graph, there will be two
vector indices -- one for the `Condition` node table's `name` property, and another for the `Symptom` node table's
`name` property. You can use any embedding model of choice and transform the `name` property values of either
table into embeddings, and ingest them into their respective tables as follows. The following code
snippet shows this.

```py
import kuzu
import polars as pl
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

db = kuzu.Database("ex_kuzu_db")
conn = kuzu.Connection(db)
# Load the embedding model
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Symptoms
symptom_ids = conn.execute("""
    MATCH (s:Symptom)
    RETURN s.name AS id
""")
symptom_ids = symptom_ids.get_as_pl() # type: ignore

# Embed symptoms
symptom_embeddings = model.encode(symptom_ids["id"].to_list()).tolist()
symptoms_df = pl.DataFrame({
    "id": symptom_ids["id"],
    "symptoms_embedding": symptom_embeddings
})
print("Finished creating symptom embeddings")

# Add a new property `symptoms_embedding` to the node table
conn.execute(
    """
    ALTER TABLE Symptom ADD IF NOT EXISTS symptoms_embedding FLOAT[384];
    """
)

# Bulk-ingest the symptom embeddings to the node table
conn.execute(
    """
    LOAD FROM symptoms_df
    MATCH (s:Symptom {name: id})
    SET s.symptoms_embedding = symptoms_embedding
    """
)
```
The code shown above gathers all the `name` property values for the `Symptom` node table and embeds them using
an embedding model from the `sentence-transformers` library in Python. A new `symptoms_embedding` property
is added to the existing node table, and the embeddings are bulk-ingested into the `Symptom` node table via Polars.
A similar approach is followed to ingest embeddings for the `Condition` node table as well. If you're
interested in the code that does this, you can find it [here](https://github.com/kuzudb/baml-kuzu-demo/blob/main/src/03_create_vector_index.py).

Once the embeddings are in the Kuzu database, it's simple to create a vector index as follows:

```py
# Create a vector index on the product summary embedding
conn.execute(
    """
    CALL CREATE_VECTOR_INDEX(
        'Symptom',    // Node table name
        'symptoms_index',  // Index name
        'symptoms_embedding'  // Column name on which to create index
    )
    """
)
```
You can now run a vector search query to find nodes whose symptoms are most similar
to "sleepiness". The vector search outputs the top 100 most similar results, and we
return the nodes' symptom names in ascending order of distance (i.e., the closest to the query vector).

```py
# Transform the query string into a vector using the same embedding model
query_vector = model.encode("sleepiness").tolist()

response = conn.execute(
    """
    CALL QUERY_VECTOR_INDEX(
        'Symptom',
        'symptoms_index',
        $query_vector,
        100
    )
    RETURN node.name AS symptom, distance
    ORDER BY distance LIMIT 1
    """,
    {"query_vector": query_vector})

print(response.get_as_pl())
```
```
┌────────────┬──────────┐
│ symptom    ┆ distance │
│ ---        ┆ ---      │
│ str        ┆ f64      │
╞════════════╪══════════╡
│ drowsiness ┆ 0.199042 │
└────────────┴──────────┘
```

The above result shows that "drowsiness" is the symptom that's closest to "sleepiness" in vector space. The two
Python functions that allow vector search on the `Symptom` and `Condition` nodes are what I'll refer to as "tools"[^8]
that an LLM can call to enhance the final output. The tools are used in the BAML workflow shown below.

## Graph RAG with BAML

Effective Graph RAG involves combining the vector search functions (as tools) with the Text2Cypher
functions. A tool-calling routing agent is implemented in order to call the right vector index depending
on the user's question. Let's look at how these parts come together.

BAML is a programming language that makes it very simple to get
structured outputs from LLMs. In the [previous post](/post/unstructured-data-to-graph-baml-kuzu/),
I showed how BAML's clean, concise syntax, its type  system, and its strong emphasis on prompt
testing makes the entire development process with LLMs a breeze. In this post, I'll continue the exercise by creating a BAML
prompt that can call the following tools:

1. `Text2Cypher`: Convert the user's question into a valid Cypher query, based on the provided graph schema
2. `PickTool`: Based on the terms used in the user's question, perform tool-calling to select the right vector search tool
that can find similar terms in the database
3. `AnswerGeneration`: Use the retrieved context to answer the user in natural language, without deviating too far from the provided context.

### Text2Cypher

The BAML function used for Text2Cypher is shown below. It takes in a graph schema, the user's question, and
an optional `additional_context` (explained further below). The function's output signature is a `Query` class
that clearly tells the LLM that we want a valid Cypher query with no newlines (per the `@description` annotation).

```rs
class Query {
  cypher string @description("Valid Cypher query with no newlines")
}

function RAGText2Cypher(schema: string, question: string, additional_context: string | null) -> Query {
  client OpenRouterGoogleGemini2Flash
  prompt #"
    Translate the given question into a valid Cypher query that respects the given graph schema.

    <INSTRUCTIONS>
    - ALWAYS respect the relationship directions (from -> to) as provided in the <SCHEMA> section.
    - Use only the provided nodes, relationships and properties in your Cypher statement.
    - Properties can be on nodes or relationships - check the schema carefully to figure out where they are.
    - When returning results, return property values rather than the entire node or relationship.
    - ALWAYS use the WHERE clause to compare string properties, and compare them using the
      LOWER() function.
    - Pay attention to the ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT to figure out what to add in the
    WHERE clause.
    - Do not use APOC as the database does not support it.
    </INSTRUCTIONS>

    {{ _.role("user") }}
    <QUESTION>
    {{ question }}
    </QUESTION>

    <ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT>
    {{ additional_context }}
    <ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT>

    <SCHEMA>
    {{ schema }}
    </SCHEMA>

    <OUTPUT_FORMAT>
    {{ ctx.output_format }}
    </OUTPUT_FORMAT>
  "#
}
```
As always, BAML formats the prompt (via `ctx.output_format`) in a way that the system instructions
and output signature are respected as much as possible[^6].
In addition, BAML encourages you to test your prompt right away (in the same file, interactively
via the editor). This makes it incredibly easy to begin experimenting and swapping out LLMs to
gauge qualitative performance on a specific task -- in this case, whether the `Text2Cypher` function
generates queries that are syntactically correct.

#### 🚩 Full path schema

The format in which the graph schema is presented in the LLM prompt is _really important_. For this blog post,
I've used the format described in a recent paper[^5], which suggests that displaying the
schema as **full paths**, i.e., the nodes and relationships as well as their property values, can
help LLMs better interpret the schema to write good enough Cypher to answer the question.

The full path schema representation of the Kuzu database is shown in the BAML test below. In the application code,
the schema information is extracted from Kuzu during query runtime and reformatted to the below format as a string.
In this way, the latest version of the graph schema is always available to the LLM each time a new query is asked.

```rs
test RAGText2Cypher1 {
  functions [RAGText2Cypher]
  args {
    schema #"
    (:Patient {patient_id: string}) -[:EXPERIENCES]-> (:Symptom {name: string})

    (:Patient {patient_id: string}) -[:IS_PRESCRIBED {date: date, dosage: string, frequency: string}]-> (:DrugGeneric {name: string})

    (:DrugGeneric {name: string}) -[:CAN_CAUSE]-> (:Symptom {name: string})

    (:DrugGeneric {name: string}) -[:HAS_BRAND]-> (:DrugBrand {name: string})

    (:Condition {name: string}) -[:IS_TREATED_BY]-> (:DrugGeneric {name: string})
    "#
    question "Which drugs are prescribed to patients with hypertension?"
    additional_context ""
  }
  // The assertions check that the right property value and node table names
  // are in the generated Cypher query
  @@assert({{ this|regex_match("[hH]ypertension") }})
  @@assert({{ ":Condition" in this.response }})
}
```

The main advantages of specifying the schema as "full paths" are the following:
- The directions of the relationships are made explicitly visible to the LLM, in the fewest tokens possible
- The property names and their data types are _right next to the node and relationship labels_. This means
that the LLM's attention window can focus on the information relevant to a path's nodes and
relationships **in the same area** of the model's token space. In contrast, stringified JSON schemas can
be overly verbose, and the property information may be separated from the node/edge labels in token space.

### Router agent with tool calling

For the router agent, BAML provides an `enum` type that makes it simple to specify tools that an LLM can call.
In this case, three tools are defined: `Text2Cypher`, `VectorSearchSymptoms` and `VectorSearchConditions`,
that are each custom Python functions wrapped as FastAPI endpoints that can be called by the application.
The `PickTool` function is shown below.

```rs
enum Tool {
    Text2Cypher  @description("Translate the question into a valid Cypher statement")
    VectorSearchSymptoms  @description("Search for symptoms or side effects mentioned in the question")
    VectorSearchConditions  @description("Search for a condition or ailment mentioned in the question")
}

function PickTool(schema: string, query: string) -> Tool {
  client OpenRouterGPT4o
  prompt #"
    A prior attempt to write a valid Cypher query failed because an exact match with
    a property value was not found. Analyze the given query and select the most appropriate tool
    that can retrieve more useful context to answer the question.

    {{ _.role("user") }}
    <QUESTION>
    {{ query }}
    </QUESTION>

    <SCHEMA>
    {{ schema}}
    </SCHEMA>

    <OUTPUT_FORMAT>
    {{ ctx.output_format }}
    </OUTPUT_FORMAT>
  "#
}
```

Note how the `PickTool` function's prompt clearly states that a prior attempt at Text2Cypher failed
to generate a response -- the LLM router kicks in and picks a tool if, and only if, the first attempt
at Text2Cypher returns an empty result (which is all too common in vanilla Graph RAG).

For the example mentioned earlier -- where the user asks for drugs that cause "sleepiness" as a side effect --
because we have the term "drowsiness" in the database, we would expect the following sequence of
events when the vector search tool is made available:

<Img src="/img/enhancing-graph-rag-with-vector-search/rag-text2cypher-3.png" width="700" alt="Example agent routing workflow" />

This time, the LLM router picks the `VectorSearchSymptoms` tool, which returns the most similar term to "sleepiness",
i.e., "drowsiness". The LLM then uses this additional context to write a better Cypher query, which is then run on the Kuzu database.
Hopefully, this approach makes sense at a conceptual level. Let's architect a router agent-based Graph
RAG system and test it, end-to-end!

### Logical flow

The logical flow of the application is described in the figure below. All deterministic steps
are shown as grey circles, and the LLM-driven steps are clearly marked as such.

<Img src="/img/enhancing-graph-rag-with-vector-search/agent-rag-2.png" alt="Agent router workflow for Graph RAG using BAML and Kuzu" />

The workflow starts with a user's question in natural language. This is translated into a Cypher query via an LLM that can interpret
the graph schema. The query is run on the Kuzu database, after which the following sequence of steps occurs:
- If the response is non-empty, end the workflow.
- If the response is empty, the routing agent (`PickTool`) kicks in. One of three tools is selected based
on the LLM's assessment of the user's question and the terms it identified.
- The vector search outputs "additional context", i.e., the most similar terms to those used in the user's question.
- The output of the vector search functions are once again sent to the `Text2Cypher` tool, which attempts
another Cypher query using the additional context.
  - If the response is non-empty, end the workflow.
  - If the response is still empty, the router agent workflow is run in a while loop until the maximum number of retries is reached,
after which the workflow ends.

### Architecture

From an architectural standpoint, the system is structured as shown below. BAML sits at the lowest level, closest to the LLM prompts,
and the client code generated by BAML's runtime is utilized by Python helper functions and classes. These are then exposed as
endpoints on a FastAPI server, which can then be used by a Streamlit frontend.

<Img src="/img/enhancing-graph-rag-with-vector-search/agent-rag-3.png" width="600" alt="Components of the agentic Graph RAG architecture" />

#### BAML for prompting

BAML is the bedrock of the prompting layer - anything that touches the LLM, goes through BAML. This ensures that
the prompts have been thoroughly tested, while ensuring that the tool-calling functionality can be expanded
as more tools become available in the future (for e.g., full-text search for keyword matches). BAML provides
a powerful type system that helps LLMs produce the desired outputs, more often than not.

#### FastAPI for serving

The helper functions that call the BAML client code (interfacing with the LLMs) are exposed as FastAPI endpoints
so that they can be used by downstream services, like a frontend that the user can interact with. One of the biggest
strengths of BAML is that it can generate client code in multiple languages (TypeScript, Ruby, Golang, etc.), so
you don't need to write the API server in Python if your application is written in another language.

#### Streamlit for user interaction

Once the API endpoints that provide access to the router agent and vector search tools are made available,
it's straightforward to implement a frontend interface to which a user can ask questions in natural language.
An example UI written in Streamlit is shown below. This is for representative purposes only -- you can add
as much custom functionality as required, in languages other than Python.

<Img src="/img/enhancing-graph-rag-with-vector-search/graph-rag-agent-router.gif" alt="Demo of the BAML-Kuzu router agent Graph RAG workflow in action" />

## Evaluation

Having put in all this work to build an end-to-end application, an important next step is to evaluate the performance
of the agentic workflow in comparison to vanilla Graph RAG over a range of queries. That's exactly what this section is about!

### Test suite

First, we'll define a test suite of 10 path-like queries, based
on an understanding of the data. These are listed below.

| # | Question | Expected terms in answer |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| Q1:  | What is the drug brand Xanax used for? | sleepy, calm, nerves |
| Q2:  | Which patients are being given drugs to lower blood pressure, and what is the drug name, dosage and frequency? | X7F3Q, ramipril, 5mg, daily |
| Q3:  | What drug is the patient B9P2T prescribed, and what is its dosage and frequency? | lansoprazole, 30mg, daily |
| Q4:  | What are the side effects of the drug brand Ambien? | drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, headache |
| Q5:  | What drugs can cause sleepiness as a side effect? | diazepam, morphine, oxycodone |
| Q6:  | Which patients experience sleepiness as a side effect? | L4D8Z |
| Q7:  | Can Vancomycin cause vomiting as a side effect? | yes |
| Q8:  | What are the side effects of drugs for conditions related to lowering cholestrol? | upset stomach, headache, muscle pain |
| Q9:  | Which patients experience sleepiness as a side effect?[^7] | L4D8Z |
| Q10:  | What drug brands treat the condition of irregular heart rhythm? | Digitek, Cordarone, Inderal, Pacerone, Lanoxin |

To pass the tests, the LLM must first write syntactically
correct Cypher, and once the retrieval from the Kuzu database yields a non-empty response, the answer-generation
LLM must then correctly translate the given context into a natural language answer that contains the expected terms.

Note that some queries in the test suite are objectively hard (and borderline impossible) to answer with naive Text2Cypher -- they
would require some sort of agentic loop. For instance, Q6 and Q7 ask about the side effects "sleepiness" and "vomiting",
but upon inspecting the data, the actual side effects that exist in the Kuzu database are "drowsiness" and "upset stomach". These
types of queries require some form of semantic search to compliment the graph retrieval. Using a router agent with tool-calling
can help with this!

To keep the experiments more controlled, the `PickTool` and `AnswerGeneration` LLMs are fixed to be the **same**
across all experiments: `openai/gpt-4o`. Only the Text2Cypher LLM is varied in each experiment. This tells us the following:
- How good is the LLM at generating syntactically correct Cypher?
- How well does the LLM reason about the graph schema and the terms mentioned in the user's question, to include
the right nodes, relationships (including direction) and property values in the generated Cypher query?

As you'll see in the results below, not all LLMs are created equal, when it comes to Text2Cypher.

### Results

The test suite is run as per the code [here](https://github.com/kuzudb/baml-kuzu-demo/tree/main/src/tests). The plots
below indicate whether the tests passed or failed.

#### Vanilla Graph RAG

When running vanilla Graph RAG (i.e., a single pass at Text2Cypher), OpenAI's `gpt-4.1` passes the most tests (4/10).
Google's `gemini-2.0-flash` is the next best model for Text2Cypher in these experiments. A lot of the smaller, cheaper and open source LLMs,
like `phi4`, `qwen3-30b` and `mistral-medium` perform markedly worse across all the queries. Certain queries like
Q6 and Q7 are not expected to pass, regardless of the LLM used, because these queries reference terms that
do not have an exact match in the database (vector search is needed to find similar terms). Under these conditions,
`gpt-4.1` and `gemini-2.0-flash` still perform admirably well.

<Img src="/img/enhancing-graph-rag-with-vector-search/vanilla_graph_rag_heatmap.png" alt="Evaluation results for vanilla Graph RAG" />

#### Router-Agent Graph RAG

Now that we have an idea of the baseline case for vanilla Graph RAG, we can get a better sense for the router agent's
performance. The same two models: `openai/gpt-4.1` and `google/gemini-2.0-flash` pass all 10 tests!
The next best model is `google/gemini-2.5-flash`, which passes 9/10 tests. The remaining
models perform better than in the vanilla Graph RAG case, but still do not always produce the expected answer,
meaning that somewhere in the intermediate stages, the Cypher queries they generated weren't good enough.

<Img src="/img/enhancing-graph-rag-with-vector-search/router_agent_graph_rag_heatmap.png" alt="Evaluation results for agentic router-based Graph RAG" />

One interesting observation is regarding the only failing test for the `google/gemini-2.5-flash` model, which several other LLMs pass.
Inpecting the BAML logs for this test, the Cypher query generated by `google/gemini-2.5-flash`
is totally wrong -- the query is syntactically incorrect, as per the `RETURN` clause shown below. The
syntax error happens repeatedly, even on multiple runs, and only on this query (Q3) with this model. Interestingly,
`google/gemini-2.0-flash` does not suffer from this problem.

```cypher
// The query below was generated by google/gemini-2.5-flash
// It's syntactically incorrect, as per the contents of the `RETURN` clause
MATCH (patient:Patient {patient_id: 'B9P2T'})-[:IS_PRESCRIBED {dosage: 'dosage', frequency: 'frequency'}]->(drug:DrugGeneric)
RETURN drug.name, IS_PRESCRIBED.dosage, IS_PRESCRIBED.frequency
```

## Observations

The log files from the test suite for each LLM can be seen [here](https://github.com/kuzudb/baml-kuzu-demo/tree/main/src/tests/results).
It's clear that frontier models from well-known providers, such as `openai/gpt-4.1` and `google/gemini-2.0-flash` are
good at reasoning on the graph schema to translate the user's question into a valid Cypher query. The `openai/gpt-4o` model
is significantly worse than `openai/gpt-4.1` at Cypher generation, indicating
that newer-generation LLMs can be significantly better than older ones, even if they're released just a few months apart.

To write a syntactically correct Cypher query, it's important that the LLM has sufficient reasoning ability
to understand the property names and the relationship directions -- this explains why the smaller, open source
models like `mistralai/mistral-medium`, `microsoft/phi4` and `qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b` perform so much worse
(they have less reasoning capabilities than the larger, proprietary models).

A common concern with using large, proprietary LLMs is cost. The following table compares the cost implications
of using these models for `Text2Cypher`.

#### Tokens in/out

The cost of LLM usage typically depends on the number of tokens going into and coming out of the LLM.

- Text2Cypher tokens in/out (approx.): 400/50
- Answer generation tokens in/out (approx.): 200/80

#### Cost

The cost numbers for each LLM call are reported on a per-query basis, as well as the estimated "queries per dollar" (QPD),
i.e., the number of queries you can run for \$1. The answer generation LLM (`openai/gpt-4o`) is kept constant in all experiments and
costs \$0.001 on average (1,000 QPD).

| Model | Cost per query | QPD (approx.) |
| --- | --- | --- |
`openai/gpt-4o` | $0.001 | 1,000 |
`openai/gpt-4.1` | $0.001 | 1,000 |
`google/gemini-2.0-flash` | $0.0001 | 10,000 |
`google/gemini-2.5-flash` | $0.0003 | 3,333 |
`microsoft/phi4` | $0.00003 | 33,333 |
`qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b` | $0.002 | 500 |
`mistralai/mistral-medium` | $0.0003 | 3,333 |

Depending on when you read this and what model you use, your cost numbers may be different. However, one thing is very clear:
**LLMs will continue to become better and cheaper**, _very quickly_, so it's always worth evaluating the latest
models for your use case.

## Conclusions

This post covered how to create a vector index in Kuzu and how to expose the function as a tool for an agentic router, with
the goal of enhancing the performance of a Graph RAG application. By placing LLMs at appropriate points in the workflow,
the performance of the vanilla Graph RAG workflow was significantly improved, across a variety of queries. The results
from multiple LLMs were compared to show that the approach can generalize to different LLMs (assuming they have sufficient
reasoning capabilities).

Using an agent router that can perform tool-calling, is just the starting point.
To build a truly robust and reliable Graph RAG application, a higher degree of autonomy is needed at multiple stages.
For example, an "agent loop" can be added to the workflow to allow an LLM to decide whether
to run the workflow again, or to end it. Additionally, a "planning agent" could be added to the workflow
to break down the user's question into a series of steps, and then run a series of Cypher queries to answer
more complex questions, followed by a "consolidation agent" to synthesize the results into a final answer.

### MCP tools

In this example, the vector search tools were exposed as REST API endpoints. This was a simple way to get started,
but it's becoming increasingly common to build custom MCP tools for each specific task, allowing LLMs an easy
way to access a variety of tools. For example, a hybrid search MCP tool (that combines vector search and keyword-based search)
could provide a more robust and flexible way to discover relevant information in the graph. As more tools
get added over time, it's relatively straightforward to extend the router agent to pick the appropriate tool
for the task at hand.

### The importance of evaluation

Due to the pace at which the agent and LLM ecosystems are evolving, having a good test suite on which
to run experiments and gauge performance,
is all the more important for building robust and reliable systems that can leverage the latest tools.
Regardless of the complexity of the workflow, it's always recommended to spend time developing a good
evaluation framework that's unique to your business case. Evaluation does not always have to be deterministic --
it could involve having "critic agents" downstream of the LLM's generated response to subjectively
analyze the quality of the response. Or, it could also involve human-in-the-loop (HITL) agents where a
human can step in at intermediate stages.

### Memory is the next frontier in AI

As more and more systems become agentic in nature, memory is becoming vital. Incorporating memory allows agents to learn
from past experiences and adapt to new tasks. Short-term memory, such as conversational memory in the current
user session, is only one part of it. Long-term memory (recall) can help agents retain context across
different interactions, while also becoming familiar with the user's preferences over time.

To build these kinds of highly autonomous multi-agent systems, frameworks can help abstract away the
code to manage session state, tool calling and memory. Knowledge graphs will also likely play an increasingly
significant role in these systems by providing LLMs with structured sources of context. At Kuzu, we're excited
to be following these developments and contributing integrations to this ever-growing ecosystem.
Over the coming months, I'll be exploring and building with some of these
agent frameworks, so stay tuned for more posts on this topic!

The authors compare the "full path" schema vs. the common formats used to specify KG schemas to LLM prompts in LangChain,
and found that their full path representation performs better on average when used by multiple different LLMs.

[^6]: In BAML, `{{ ctx.output_format }}` is used within a prompt to print out the function’s output
schema into the actual prompt sent to the LLM API. It describes to the LLM how to generate a structure
BAML can parse (usually JSON). See the [BAML docs](https://docs.boundaryml.com/ref/prompt-syntax/ctx-output-format)
for more details.

[^7]: Q9 is the same as Q6, and this is intentional -- we want to test whether the LLM repeatably passes or
fails on the same query. The `qwen3-30b-a3b` model shows inconsistent performance, failing Q6 but passing Q9.

[^8]: Tools can be simple Python functions, REST API endpoints, or custom MCP servers that connect to the underlying database.
It's totally up to the developer to expose the right tools for the task at hand. Routing agents are commonly used to
pick from various tools based on the output from the previous stage.
