We are excited to announce the second release: v0.7.1 of kuzu in 2025. This release brings a new extension: Unity Catalog which allows you to scan/copy from Delta Lake tables managed by Unity Catalog.

In addition to the new extension, we also improved our existing extensions by introducing new features:
- Support for scanning/copying from/writing to files hosted on [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)(GCS) filesystem.
- Support for customizing the stopwords table used in full-text search.

Finally, we’ve significantly improved our execution of distinct aggregation queries via a new parallel distinct hash aggregation mechanism.
In the following sections, we dive into details.
