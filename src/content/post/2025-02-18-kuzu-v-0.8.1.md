We are excited to announce the second release: v0.8.1 of kuzu in 2025. This release brings a new extension: Unity Catalog which allows you to scan/copy from Delta Lake tables managed by Unity Catalog.

In addition to the new extension, we also improved our existing extensions by introducing new features:
- Support for scanning/copying from/writing to files hosted on [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)(GCS) filesystem.
- Support for customizing the stopwords table used in full-text search.

Finally, we’ve significantly improved our execution of distinct aggregation queries via a new parallel distinct hash aggregation mechanism.
In the following sections, we dive into details.

## New Features

### Unity Catalog Extension
We're introducing an experimental `unity_catalog` extension to enable scanning/copying from Delta Lake tables managed by [Unity Catalog](https://www.unitycatalog.io/]).

### GCS FileSystem Support
Our `httpfs` extension now supports working with files on [Google Cloud Storage(GCS)](https://cloud.google.com/storage). Any operation that we supported with Amazon S3 will now work with GCS. This includes:
- [Scanning (`COPY/LOAD FROM`) from files hosted on GCS](//docs.kuzudb.com/extensions/httpfs#reading-from-gcs)
- [Writing to (`COPY TO`) files hosted on GCS](//docs.kuzudb.com/extensions/httpfs#uploading-to-gcs)
- [Attaching to a read-only kuzu database hosted on GCS](//docs.kuzudb.com/extensions/attach/kuzu)

To work with GCS, you must configure kuzu to use your `GCS HMAC keys`(https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/hmackeys):

```sql
CALL gcs_access_key_id='${GCS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}';
CALL gcs_secret_access_key='${GCS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}'
```

After configuring your credentials, you can access files on GCS by using urls in the format `gcs://${BUCKET_NAME}/${PATH_TO_FILE_IN_BUCKET}`:

```sql
LOAD FROM 'gs://kuzudb-test/user.csv' return *; // scan from GCS
COPY (MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p) TO 'gcs://kuzudb-test/person.csv' (header=true); // upload to GCS
ATTACH 'gcs://kuzudb-test/tinysnb/' as tinysnb (dbtype kuzu); // attach remote DB in GCS
```

### Stopwords customization in Full-text Search (FTS)
