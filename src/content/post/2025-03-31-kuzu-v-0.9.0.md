## New Features
### Vector Index

### Scan from Postgres with arbitrary SQL statements
In our previous release, we introduced the [Postgres extension](https://docs.kuzudb.com/extensions/attach/rdbms/) that enabled direct table scanning from PostgreSQL databases. Now we're extending the capability with our new `SQL_QUERY` function, which allows users to execute arbitrary read-only SQL queries on attached PostgreSQL databases and retrieve the query result in kuzu.

#### Getting Started with the `SQL_QUERY` function:

To utilize the `SQL_QUERY` function, we firstly have to install and load the `postgres` extension:
```sql
INSTALL POSTGRES;
LOAD POSTGRES;
```
Then, we have to attach our target PostgreSQL database using POSTGRES connection string:

```sql
ATTACH 'dbname=university user=postgres host=localhost password=yourpassword port=5432' AS uw (dbtype postgres);
```

#### Execute arbitrary read-only SQL query and retrieve the result in kuzu:

The `SQL_QUERY` function accepts two arguments:

`ATTACHED_DB_NAME`: The name of the attached database (uw in our example)

`SQL_QUERY`: A read-only SQL query string to execute

For instance, to retrieve all individuals aged over 20 from our `` PostgreSQL person table:

```sql
CALL SQL_QUERY('uw', 'SELECT * FROM person WHERE age > 20') 
RETURN *;
```

### WASM with bundled extensions

## APIs and Ecosystem Integrations
### New Sync and Async APIs

### Unity Catalog

### MCP

### Gdotv

## Performance Improvements
### Aggregation

### Create FTS
In our previous [release](https://blog.kuzudb.com/post/kuzu-0.8.0-release/), we have released the fts extension to enable full-text search capabilities using the BM25 scoring algorithm. To give a sense of the improvement, here is a benchmark on our current create_fts_index performance. We used the ms-passage dataset, which contains 8.8M documents that take 2.9GB in raw size. We used a machine with 2 AMD EPYC 7551 CPUs with 64 cores, using 409GB of buffer manager. In our `v0.8.0` release, index creation took 460 seconds â€“ but with v0.9.0, this process now completes in just 108 seconds, achieving a **~4x performance improvement**.
