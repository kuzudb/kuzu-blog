## K첫zu WASM

## Full-Text search

## User-facing features

### More DataFrame scan options

**Skip errorneous rows**
Previously we have supported skip errorneous rows when bulk inserting into table through CSV and Parquet files. We extend this support to DataFrame in this release.

**Support skip limit rows**


### Rel group deprecation
Current version of K첫zu uses two notions (relationship table and relationship table group) to differentiate if a relationship is defined over one or more from/to node pairs.


## Performance improvement

### Improved parallel hash aggregate
