We're here to introduce Kuzu 0.0.8, which is a minor bug-fix release together with some performance optimizations:

- Fixed a major bug in COPY on large datasets. [PR 1963](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/pull/1963)
- Implemented the [TopK optimization](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/pull/1949), significantly enhancing the performance of queries that involve ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses. We will delve deeper into this optimization in a blog post. [PR 1949](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/pull/1949)
- WITH clause (CTE) rewriter. We avoid the evaluation of node and rel in CTE projection if it's not needed for further processing. [PR 1956](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/pull/1956)
- Updated our Rust doc with converting query result to arrow arrays.
- Fixed the size allocated for boolean values to match the size of the bit-packed data. [PR 1953](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/pull/1953/files)
