We are thrilled to announce the release of Kuzu 0.0.6, which focuses on addressing bugs reported by our users. We addressed the following issues in this bug-fix release:

1. Resolved a segmentation fault occurring while loading overflow data types with parallelism.
2. Fixed an issue of reading out of bound for LIST vector null buffer.
3. Implemented several missing data types in C, JAVA, Rust, and Python API bindings.

We extend our sincere gratitude to all our users who reported these bugs, as well as to everyone who supported us throughout this process. Your feedback is instrumental in making Kuzu better!
