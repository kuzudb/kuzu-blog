## Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms are essential tools for extracting meaningful insights from connected data. Whether you're detecting fraud patterns in financial transactions, optimizing supply chain networks, or analyzing social media interactions, these algorithms help you understand complex relationships and make data-driven decisions.
With our graph data science extension, you can now perform these analyses efficiently at scale, without needing to export your data to specialized graph analytics tools.

The graph data science extension has three important features:

- **Parallalize at scale**: algorithms are executed through a parallel framework based on [Ligra paper]() and ensures great scalability for large scale dataset. 
- **Disk-based**: algorithms are disk-based and implemented with Kuzu storage engine. Therefore, memory is not a limitation as your graph scales.
- **Native cypher integration**: All algorithms are abstracted as function and thus can be combined with arbitrary cypher pattern matching.

The initial release includes the following algorithms

- Weakly connected components
- Strongly connected components
- PageRank
- K-Core decomposition
- Louvain
- (ALL) Weighted shortest path

### Benchmark

Below is a benchmark demonstrates the performance and scalability of our graph algorithm framework. All benchmarks run on ...


| Dataset | # Nodes | # Edges | Raw File Size |
|---------|---------|---------|---------------|
| D1 |  |  |  |
| D2 |  |  |  |
| D3 |  |  |  |

D1

| Algorithm | 4 threads | 16 threads | 64 threads |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| WCC |  |  |  |
| SCC |  |  |  |
| PageRank | | | |
| K-Core | | | |
| Louvain | | | |
| WSP | | | |
| All WSP | | | |

### Example

Graph algorithms are provided as an [extension](). We illustrate the usage of graph algorithms extension with an example using [LDBC SNB dataset]().

```cypher
// TODO(Xiyang): complete and test
CALL create_projected_graph('Knows_Graph', [], []);

// 
CALL page_rank()
```

## Neo4j migration 

To help user migrate their data from Neo4j more smoothly, we introduce a Neo4j migration tool that automatically infers schema of your neo4j database and import to Kuzu.

To migrate a Neo4j database, simply install [`neo4j`]() extension in kuzu and then run
```cypher
CALL neo4j_migrate(
    'host_name',
    'user_name',
    'password',
    ['node_label_1', 'node_label_2', ...],
    ['rel_label_1', 'rel_label_2', ...]
)
```
with the node and relationship labels you wanna migrate.

## Scan compressed CSV

Large CSV files are usually distributed in compressed formats. Kuzu now supports scanning directly from gzipped csv files without manual decompression.

Consider a `user.csv` file, its gzipped version `user.csv.gz` can be obtained by
```shell
gzip -k user.csv
```

The compressed file can then be read by Kuzu through
```cypher
LOAD FROM 'user.csv.gz' RETURN *;
```
It can also be used for bulk insertion
```cypher
COPY User FROM 'user.csv.gz';
```
