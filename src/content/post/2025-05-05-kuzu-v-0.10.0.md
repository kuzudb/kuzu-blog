Welcome back! It's the start of summer in ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, and we're excited to kick it off with the release of Kuzu 0.10.0!
Here are the highlights of this release:

- **Graph algorithms**: The main highlight is our new **algo** extension, which brings graph algorithms to Kuzu.
Graph algorithms, such as PageRank, Louvain, or k-core decomposition algorithms, 
are useful for extracting meaningful insights from your connected data. Now you can run them natively in Kuzu
with a single `CALL` function. Whether you're detecting fraud patterns in financial transactions, 
optimizing supply chain networks, or analyzing social media interactions,
running graph algorithms natively in Kuzu can help reveal patterns and make data-driven decisions from your graphs.
- **Neo4j migration extension:** With the `neo4j` extension, you can now migrate your Neo4j databases over to Kuzu with 
another single `CALL` function (and a few parameters).
- **Android support:** Kuzu now supports Android devices with ARMv8-A architecture!
- **Scanning compressed CSV files:** The `LOAD FROM` and `COPY FROM` commands now support scanning compressed CSV files.
- **Free-space management:** We have introduced a new free space management mechanism that reclaims disk space usage. This can lead to significant reduction in database size after frequent data modifications.

As always, we have continued making Kuzu faster and more scalable, and you should see your recursive queries and JSON scans
get faster, and the disk size of your database files get smaller. See some performance numbers below!


## Graph algorithms

Here are the key features of Kuzu's graph algorithms extension:

- **Parallel**: Graph algorithms execute in parallel (except those algorithms that cannot be parallelized).
If you're interested in the implementation details of Kuzu, we internally use a vertex and edge-centric 
parallelization abstraction, similar to the [Ligra paper](https://jshun.csail.mit.edu/ligra.pdf) and uses
the system's own thread pool (instead of, say, OpenMP).  
- **Disk-based**: The algorithms run on "projected graphs", which can be
  the entire graph in your database or a subgraph of it. Importantly, 
  the algorithms are disk-based, meaning that they can run on 
  projected graphs that are larger than your available memory. So you don't need to worry about memory
limits as you scale your graph workloads.
- **Native Cypher integration**: You run the algorithms via `CALL` function in Cypher and can combine 
the outputs with arbitrary Cypher queries.

The initial release includes the following algorithms in our `algo` extension:
- Weakly connected components
- Strongly connected components (a parallel BFS-based and a single-threaded one based on [Kosaraju's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosaraju%27s_algorithm))
- PageRank
- K-Core decomposition
- Louvain

In addition, you can compute *weighted shortest paths* directly in your Cypher path patterns in the MATCH clause 
using the `WSHORTEST` keyword, e.g., `()-[:Label* WSHORTEST(property) 1..max]->()`
See the documentation for weighted shortest paths [here](https://docs.kuzudb.com/cypher/query-clauses/match/#shortest-path).
We will be implementing many more algorithms in our future releases, so stay tuned!

### Using graph algorithms

All algorithms, except for [weighted shortest paths](https://docs.kuzudb.com/cypher/query-clauses/match#shortest-path) which is provided through the built-in `WSHORTEST` clause, 
are available via the [`algo` extension](https://docs.kuzudb.com/extensions/algos). 
Let's look at example usage of graph algorithms using the well-known LDBC SNB dataset.
The example beloew finds top 10 influencers based on the `(person)-[:knows]->(person)` subgraph and counts how many posts they have published.

```cypher
// Install graph algorthm extension
INSTALL algo;
LOAD algo;

// Create a projected graph with person and knows tables.
CALL project_graph(
    'KnowsGraph', 
    ['person'], 
    ['knows']
);

// Run PageRank on projected graph to find the top 10 influencers.
// Then traverse `postHasCreator` to extract all posts
CALL page_rank('KnowsGraph')
WITH node AS person, rank
ORDER BY rank DESC
LIMIT 10
MATCH (person)<-[:postHasCreator]-(post:Post)
RETURN person, COUNT(*);
```

We first install and load the `algo` extension. Then, we create a projected graph from the `person` and `knows` tables,
on which the algorithm is executed. The projected graph is a subgraph that contains only the nodes and
relationships specified. It is evaluated only when the algorithm is executed. Kuzu does not materialize projected
graphs in memory and all data is scanned from disk on-the-fly. 

### Using graph algorithms on filtered graphs

Graph algorithms can also run on a subset of nodes and relationships using a filtered graph. 
From the example above, we can find influencers within a certain age group, e.g. 30-45, with a
filtered projected graph.

```cypher
// Create a filtered graph selecting person within the age group
CALL project_graph(
    'FilteredKnowsGraph', 
    { 'person': 'n.birthday >= date("1980-01-01") AND n.birthday <= date("1995-12-31")' },
    ['knows']
);

// Run PageRank on filtered projected graph
CALL page_rank('FilteredKnowsGraph')
WITH node AS person, rank
ORDER BY rank DESC
LIMIT 10
MATCH (person)<-[:postHasCreator]-(post:Post)
RETURN person, COUNT(*);
```

Using these techniques, we can run graph algorithms efficiently and scalably all within Kuzu. If you're
interested in using Kuzu's graph algorithms, give it a try, and check out the [docs](https://docs.kuzudb.com/extensions/algos) here.

### Performance benchmarks

Let's next demonstrate the performance and scalability of our graph algorithms in Kuzu on two
benchmark datasets and various thread configurations.
The following two datasets are from different domains ranging from millions to billions of edges.

| Dataset | # Nodes | # Edges |
|---------|---------|---------|
| soc-LiveJournal1 | 4.8M | 68M |
| datagen-sf10k | 100M | 9.4B |

We report the end-to-end runtimes on a machine with 2xAMD EPYC 9J14 CPUs and 768GB RAM, using 4, 16 and
64 threads for execution.

#### soc-LiveJournal1

| Algorithm | 4 threads | 16 threads | 64 threads |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| WCC | 3.6s  | 0.9s | 0.3s |
| SCC | 9.6s | 2.6s | 0.9s |
| SCC-ko | 8.3s | 8.2s | 8.2s |
| PageRank | 19.9s | 6.9s | 5.1s |
| K-Core | 46.7s | 13.3s | 9.2s |
| Louvain | 102.2s | 42.7s | 21.2s |
| WSP | 13.6s | 3.8s | 1.1s |

#### datagen-sf10k[^1]

[^1]: Our Louvain implementation currently requires building an in-memory graph, which is memory-intensive, and requires more than the default buffer manager size on datagen-sf10k, so we omit Louvain in this dataset. This will be improved in our future releases.

| Algorithm | 4 threads | 16 threads | 64 threads |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| WCC | 201.4s | 54.3s | 19.7s |
| SCC | 9905.6s | 2563.7s | 849.3s |
| SCC-ko | 273.5s | 271.2s | 280.0s |
| PageRank | 992.5s| 299.4s | 146.5s |
| K-Core | 585.6s | 151.8s | 52.7s |
| WSP | 4.8s | 2.5s | 0.7s |

Observe that except for Kosaraju's algorithm, which is single threaded, 
our algorithms are able to scales very well as the number of threads increases! 
Observe further that even on a graph with 9.4 billion edges, we are able to
compute some of the batch algorithms, within seconds!

## Neo4j migration extension 

A lot of Kuzu users have previously used or are using Neo4j. 
To make it easier to migrate graph data from Neo4j to Kuzu, we introduce a [`neo4j`](https://docs.kuzudb.com/extensions/neo4j) extension, 
which automatically imports nodes and relationships from Neo4j to Kuzu databases.

Install the `neo4j` extension in Kuzu and then run the following query that specifies the Neo4j database host, username, password, 
and the node and relationship labels you want to migrate.

```cypher
CALL neo4j_migrate(
    'url',
    'user_name',
    'password',
    ['node_label_1', 'node_label_2', ...],
    ['rel_label_1', 'rel_label_2', ...]
)
```

After the function executes, you will have the same Neo4j database replicated in Kuzu!
Note that the Neo4j migration functionality depends on Neo4j's APOC extension to be installed in your Neo4j instance.
You can find more details on setting up the APOC extension in Neo4j [here](https://docs.kuzudb.com/extensions/neo4j#set-up-neo4j-apoc-extension). Read more on Kuzu's Neo4j extension [here](https://docs.kuzudb.com/extensions/neo4j).

## Android support

If you are interested in building Android mobile applications using Kuzu,
we're excited to now support Android devices with ARMv8-A architecture!
You can especially use Kuzu's [Java API](https://docs.kuzudb.com/system-requirements/#java), which works directly with Android Studio projects.
You can also use C/C++ dynamic lib and our shell.

## Scanning compressed CSV

Many users requested the ability to scan or copy their compressed CSV files directly in Kuzu. 
We're happy to add support
for scanning or copying `.gzip.csv` files directly into Kuzu starting from this release.

Consider a `user.csv` file. Let's first zip this file to a new file named `user.csv.gz` as follows:

```shell
gzip -k user.csv
```

The compressed CSV file can now be scanned or copied into a Kuzu table with the same commands
you use for copying or scanning uncompressed CSV files:
```cypher
// scan
LOAD FROM 'user.csv.gz' RETURN *;
// copy
COPY User FROM 'user.csv.gz';
```

Storing compressed CSV files in Kuzu is useful when importing data from external systems that store
data in compressed CSV format, such as object stores. See [here](https://docs.kuzudb.com/import/csv/#compressed-csv-files)
for more details on this feature.

## Performance Improvements

You'll notice that Kuzu is now faster than ever, particularly for recursive queries and JSON scans. Additionally,
this release includes a new free space management mechanism to help reduce disk space usage, so you can keep your disk utilization in check.

### Free Space Management

Reusing disk space usage has been a long awaited feature in Kuzu.
Up until this release, databases became bloated after frequent data modifications, such as updates and deletions.
We introduce a new free space management mechanism that is able to reclaim free space in three key scenarios:
1. When tables are dropped
2. When tuples within a node group are all deleted
3. When column chunks are rewritten due to updates or insertions

If you have workloads in which you create and drop tables or insert and delete large numbers of tuples from
tables, you can see a significant reduction in disk space usage from this feature!

### Recursive queries

In v0.9.0, we had introduced a parallel framework for recursive queries.
We used to blindly use "dense" data structures to store the intermedate data
for recursive queries. By "dense", we mean that we allocated space for each node 
in the graph during the recursive query execution, even if the recursive query 
traversed a small fraction of the database. For some queries, this was becoming a bottleneck.
In v0.10.0, we eliminate the bottleneck by starting with a small allocation
and dynamically growing the data structure.
So you can see some of your recursive queries getting much faster in this release!

### JSON scan

In v0.10,0, we've also significantly improved the performance
of JSON scanning. Below, we show a micro benchmark that scans LDBC-100 comment table in JSON format.

```cypher
LOAD FROM 'comment.json' RETURN ID, content;
```

|  | 1 thread | 2 threads | 4 threads |
|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| v0.9    | 190s    | 99s      | 52s      |
| v0.10   | 56s    | 27s      | 15s     |

If you are inserting data from json sources, there should be a noticeable 
performance improvement to your workload when you migrate to v0.10.0.

## Closing remarks

At Kuzu, we want to make it easier for developers to work with large graphs, and with the addition of
a fully native graph algorithms extension, we now provide a more complete feature set
for your graph analytics needs. All these new features and performance improvements have been
a long time in the making, and we're excited to see users push the boundaries
of what's possible with graph databases. If you're working with large graphs and want to run
graph algorithms such as PageRank, give the latest release a try!

We recently crossed 2000 stars [on GitHub](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu), and we're seeing a lot
of activity on our [Discord server](https://kuzudb.com/chat) than ever before. Thank you all for your
questions and feedback -- we're always looking for ways to make Kuzu even better. Keep them coming,
and see you in the next release!
