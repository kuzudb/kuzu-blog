Opening

## Single file database

Starting from v0.11.0, Kuzu switches to a single-file format. A Kuzu database is now a file that can be moved or shared easily.
This single-file design has been adopted in other embedded database systems, such as DuckDB and SQLite.

@prashanth we should mention this may break changes for user and what they should pay attention to.


## Vector & Full-text-search index

### Mutable indices

Kuzu now support multable vector index and full-text-search index. Once indices are defined on a table, any insertion and deletion
on the table will automatically trigger a change in related indices. Insertion includes both create statement and copy statement.

@guodong let's still do some benchmark on insertion and decide if we should put anything here.

### Vector filtered search with arbitrary cypher query

In v0.10, we release vector filtered search with simple predicate on single table. This release generates the predicate to be
arbitrary cypher query. The following example

### Full-text-search performance improvement

@ziyi list both creation and query performance

## Emebedding extension

We introduce a new extension that can create text embeddings through the following providers 

* [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)
* [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/titan-embedding-models.html)
* [Google Vertex](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-text-embeddings)
* [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/embeddings)
* [Voyage AI](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/embeddings)
* [Ollama](https://ollama.com/blog/embedding-models)

@prashanth I believe the example should be a combination of vector search & create embedding.

## Azure 

@prashanth I prefer not mentioning this in the post because it's not a complete feature.

## Swift API

Kuzu now runs on apple devices through our Swift API. This aligns with our vision of running everywhere as embedded graph database.

(Maybe) Stay tuned for our blog post of running Kuzu on iPhone?
