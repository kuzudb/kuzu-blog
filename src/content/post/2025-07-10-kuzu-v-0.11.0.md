We list all types of files that may be created and maanged by Kuzu in the following table:

| File Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Database file | `db_file` |
| Lock file | `db_file.lock` |
| WAL file | `db_file.wal`  |
| Shadow file | `db_file.shadow` |
| Tmp file | `db_file.tmp` |
| Extension files | `~/.kuzu/extensions/0.11.0/osx_arm64/json/libjson.kuzu_extension` |
