Constructing real-world knowledge graphs often involves combining or merging data from multiple sources.
However, the same entity may be represented in different ways across these sources, leading to challenges
in disambiguating similar-looking entities that we can merge into a unified dataset.
If you've ever faced this kind of problem when working with graphs or data in general,
you've come to the right place!

In this post, we'll showcase a two-part workflow involving vector embeddings and an "LLM-as-a-judge"
to disambiguate entities so that we can enrich one dataset with information from another. The LLM
part of the workflow uses [DSPy](https://dspy.ai/learn/), a declarative framework for building
compound AI pipelines. The goal of this post is to give a gentle introduction to DSPy and the powerful
primitives it provides, so that you can repurpose these ideas, and be more productive applying
LLMs in your own domains.

## Motivation

Graphs are a powerful way to represent complex relationships between entities -- finding
centres of influence within a network can yield valuable insights in numerous domains. A particularly
interesting graph that we'll use in this post, is the Nobel laureate mentorship network, which captures
the professor-student relationships of Nobel laureates and candidates (termed "scholars").
Asking about which scholars were particularly influential in the mentorship network of
Nobel laureates is, inherently, a _graph question_, because it involves analyzing the deeply
interconnected mentorship relations[^1]. Wouldn't it be fascinating to create and explore
such a knowledge graph[^2]?

### Primary data source

We use a dataset of Nobel laureates and their mentorship relationships[^1] from this [repo](https://github.com/rtol/NobelNetwork).
After some data wrangling to get the information out of the original format, we end up with a nested JSON
structure that captures the parent-children relationships between laureates and their mentors.
The information about each scholar only includes their name, type ("laureate" if they won
a Nobel prize, or "scholar" if they did not), and category and year of the award (if applicable).
Only four categories are included in this dataset: Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, and Economics,
with all prizes being awarded between the years 1901-2021.

```json
[
  {
    "children": [
      {
        "name": "George Smith",
        "type": "laureate",
        "category": "Physics",
        "year": 2009
      }
    ],
    "parents": [
      {
        "name": "Andrew Lawson",
        "type": "scholar"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

This primary source data is useful to understand the mentorship _structure_, but it doesn't contain deep enough
information on each laureate instance, such as their city or country of birth, their gender, etc. -- so this limits
the kinds of questions we can ask about the entities in the graph.

### Enrichment data source

To augment or enrich this primary data, we use the official [Nobel Prize API](https://www.nobelprize.org/about/developer-zone-2/),
which provides high-quality data about the laureates, including their biographies, birth dates,
affiliations, and more. The API is well-documented and easy to use, returning rich data about each
laureate in a structured format.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "840",
    "knownName": "George E. Smith",
    "givenName": "George E.",
    "familyName": "Smith",
    "fullName": "George E. Smith",
    "gender": "male",
    "birthDate": "1930-05-10",
    "birthPlaceCity": "White Plains, NY",
    "birthPlaceCountry": "USA",
    "birthPlaceCityNow": "White Plains, NY",
    "birthPlaceCountryNow": "USA",
    "birthPlaceContinent": "North America",
    "deathDate": null,
    "prizes": [
      {
        "awardYear": "2009",
        "category": "Physics",
        "portion": "1/4",
        "dateAwarded": "2009-10-06",
        "motivation": "for the invention of an imaging semiconductor circuit - the CCD sensor",
        "prizeAmount": 10000000,
        "prizeAmountAdjusted": 13471654,
        "affiliations": [
          {
            "name": "Bell Laboratories",
            "nameNow": "Bell Laboratories",
            "city": "Murray Hill, NJ",
            "country": "USA",
            "cityNow": "Murray Hill, NJ",
            "countryNow": "USA",
            "continent": "North America"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

The problem is that there doesn't exist a direct mapping between the laureates in the primary
source (which have only names, often partial names) and the official Nobel Prize API source data, which
contains much richer information as shown above. This means that we need to use an alternative
means to merge these two data sources. Once this is done (as per the methodology discussed below),
the resulting knowledge graph in Kuzu looks something like this[^6]:

<img src="/img/intro-to-dspy-data-enrichment/laureates-1.png" alt="Nobel laureate mentorship network" width="700" />

This is _much_ more interesting! The graph constructed from the enriched data contains a lot
of information that was not in the primary source, which means we can now answer questions like this:

- How many Physics laureates were born in the US but were affiliated with University of Cambridge?
- Who were the mentors of female laureates that won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry?
- Which laureates were mentored by other laureates affiliated with non-US institutions?

As a bonus, the primary data source (the mentorship network) contains scholars dating back
hundreds of years, all the way to the 16th century, to the days of Galileo and Isaac Newton 🤯.
So we can also explore historical trends in mentorship that shaped the landscape of today's prize winners.

## Methodology

To enrich the primary data, we need to ascertain (with a high degree
of confidence) whether a given laureate in the secondary dataset is an **exact match** with
the laureate mentioned in the primary data. To do this, we'll need to compare not only the
names of the laureates, but also the prize category and the year they won the prize.

Rather than writing complex rule-based logic to compare substrings of names and other attributes,
we can use an LLM pipeline orchestrated by DSPy. For each laureate
in the primary data, we'll use **vector search** retrieve the top$_k$ most-similar laureates
(based on name, category, and year) from the secondary data.
This set of top$_k$ names from the secondary data is sent as context to an LLM to determine which of
them is the exact same person as the primary data laureate.

It's natural to wonder: why use LLMs at all? Why not _**only**_ use vector similarity scores to judge
if two laureates are the same? In practice, this doesn't work well,
because there are several cases where the names of the same laureates are spelled drastically differently
("John Strutt" vs. "Lord Rayleigh"[^3]), or where multiple unrelated laureates have very similar names
("George E. Smith" vs. "George P. Smith"). When given sufficiently good context, for e.g., combining the
full name with the Nobel prize category and the award year, LLMs are _very_ good at
acting as judges to disambiguate the entities.

Let's summarize the key parts of our methodology:

1. **Vector search**: Use vector embeddings to find the top$_k$ most-similar laureates in the secondary data for each
   laureate in the primary data.
2. **LLM-as-a-judge**: Use an "LLM-as-a-judge" to determine which of the $k$ most similar laureates is the exact same person
   as the primary data laureate.

At the end of the second stage, we get a mapping of IDs between the two datasets, which is sufficient to
merge the two such that we have a single unified graph with all the information needed to answer a wider range of questions.

## Why DSPy?

[DSPy](https://dspy.ai/learn/) (**D**eclarative **S**elf-improving programs in **Py**thon) is an open source
Python framework that provides powerful primitives to _**program**_, not prompt, LLMs.
For workflows that involve multiple steps, DSPy allows you to
concisely and elegantly mix together LLM-driven functions with deterministic functions, allowing for
greater flexibility in building and reasoning about complex workflows.

The conventional way to build such an AI pipeline is to write prompts as strings and pass templated variables to them.
In DSPy, **no prompts are written by a human**. Instead, you declare your _intent_ via your program (e.g., Python),
and the framework automatically generates (and if needed, optimizes) the prompts for you. There are
three fundamental primitives in DSPy that are important to know about:

<img src="/img/intro-to-dspy-data-enrichment/dspy-primitives.png" alt="DSPy primitives" width="600" />

1. **Signatures**: A `Signature` allows you to define the _**behaviour**_ of your pipeline, via a type system
that specifies input and output types to the LLM. A signature lets you tell the LLM _what_ it needs to do, rather than specify _how_ it should do it.
1. **Modules**: A `Module` is the core building block of an LLM pipeline in DSPy. It's generalized
 to handle any signature, and it lets you define the _**strategy**_ for how to prompt the LLM. DSPy modules are _composable_,
 meaning that you can combine multiple modules together to create a more complex module. Two common built-in
 modules in DSPy are listed below, but there are several more described in their [docs](https://dspy.ai/learn/programming/modules/).
    - A `Predict` module simply asks an LLM to predict the output given an input
    - A `ChainOfThought` module combines multiple `Predict` modules with some additional logic for reasoning over the inputs
before making a final prediction
1. **Optimizers**: You can use an `Optimizer` to improve the performance of a DSPy module with annotated
examples of input-output pairs. The optimizer will automatically generate and improve the prompts or
the language model weights to produce a new, improved module that can perform better on the same task with the
same language model.

To sum up, DSPy does away with the traditional notion of "writing prompts by hand" -- instead, you declare your
_intent_ via the program itself, via signatures and modules.
Using optimizers is totally optional -- for this introductory post, we'll not be using them, instead just
sticking with DSPy's automatically generated base prompts.

## Workflow

### Vector indexing

The first step in our workflow is to create a vector index of key properties of the laureates in both datasets
so that we can use vector search to build the context for the LLM-as-a-judge downstream. Each entry in the primary
dataset is transformed into a vector embedding and stored in Kuzu, which provides a fast and convenient-to-use
vector index.

<img src="/img/intro-to-dspy-data-enrichment/embedding-generation.png" alt="Embedding generation and vector index creation in Kuzu" />

Two separate node tables are created in Kuzu for laureates from each data source. The embeddings are
created using an embedding model (`nomic-embed-text` in Ollama) and stored as a new column in
each node table as shown in the diagram above. Once the embeddings are ingested into Kuzu, we can run the
`CALL CREATE_VECTOR_INDEX` command to create a vector index on either table.
If you're interested, the code for these steps is available [here](https://github.com/kuzudb/dspy-kuzu-demo/blob/main/s1_create_embeddings.py).

To test the quality of the embeddings, we can run a simple vector search query in Kuzu to find the top$_k$ most similar
laureates in the secondary dataset for a given laureate in the primary dataset. The image below shows the
results of such a query for the laureate "George P. Smith" (2018 Chemistry laureate) who has the same first
and last name as "George E. Smith" (2009 Physics laureate). Because the embeddings are generated from `(full name,
category, year)`, the primary node "George Smith" on the right is most similar to "George E. Smith",
because the term "physics" that's used in the embedding, increases its similarity to the latter
(who won the Physics Nobel prize).

<img src="/img/intro-to-dspy-data-enrichment/similarity-scores.png" alt="Vector similarity scores in Kuzu vector index for two people with the same first and last name" />

### _LLM as a judge_ with DSPy

We're now ready to begin the second stage of our workflow: using DSPy to help disambiguate the laureates
from either dataset. Each component of the pipeline is explained below.

#### Language models

DSPy supports several language models through the LiteLLM interface, allowing you to use any
LLM as its backend provider. Below, we show how to set up a language model in DSPy using OpenRouter
with the `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001` model, but you can switch to any other LLM provider
you prefer.

```py
import dspy

# Using OpenRouter. Switch to another LLM provider as needed
lm = dspy.LM(
    model="openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001",
    api_base="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key=OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
)
dspy.configure(lm=lm)

```

#### Types

To define the types of the input and output for our DSPy pipeline, we use Pydantic models.
These models will be used to define the signatures of the DSPy modules that we create later.

```py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Scholar(BaseModel):
    # This is from the primary dataset
    name: str
    category: str


class Reference(BaseModel):
    # This is from the secondary dataset (Nobel Prize API)
    id: int
    knownName: str
    fullName: str
    category: str
```

For this example, our data model is simple: we have a `Scholar` type that represents
the laureate in the primary dataset, and a `Reference` type that represents the laureate
in the secondary dataset. We want a mapping for _each and every_ scholar name in the primary dataset
to an `id` in the secondary dataset, so that we can confidently merge the two datasets.

#### Signatures

We can now define a DSPy `Signature` that defines the behaviour of our DSPy module. This is done
by specifying the input and output types that the module expects, along with an optional description
of each field. The contents of the docstring are also important -- DSPy will append these to
the system prompt that it generates.

```py
class EntityHandler(dspy.Signature):
    """
    Return the reference record `id` that's most likely the same person as the sample record.
    - The result must contain ONLY ONE reference record `id`
    - Also return the confidence level of the mapping based on your judgment.
    """
    sample: Scholar = dspy.InputField(desc="A sample scholar record")
    reference_records: list[Reference] = dspy.InputField(
        desc="A list of reference records from the official Nobel Prize API"
    )
    output: int = dspy.OutputField(desc="Most similar reference record to the sample record")
    confidence: Literal["high", "low"] = dspy.OutputField(
        desc="The confidence level of mapping the sample record to one of the reference records"
    )
```

Fields marked by `dspy.InputField()` are inputs to the module, and those marked by `dspy.OutputField()`
are outputs. For the outputs, we ask for an integer value that represents the `id` of the reference record,
and a literal string value that indicates the LLM's confidence level in the mapping. If the
context provided to the LLM is insufficient, we'd expect the LLM to return a "low" confidence level[^4].

#### Modules

DSPy allows you to define custom [modules](https://dspy.ai/learn/programming/modules/) with ease, but
for this case, the simple `Predict` built-in module is sufficient[^5]. This is defined as an async function
in Python that takes in a single sample record (primary dataset) and a list of reference records
(secondary dataset), and returns the output as defined in the `EntityHandler` signature.

```py
async def execute_entity_disambiguation(
    sample: Scholar, reference_records: list[Reference]
) -> tuple[int, str]:
    """
    Execute the DSPy entity disambiguation module.

    The approach is similar to "LLM as a judge". The LLM is given a list of reference records
    and a sample laureate record, and it needs to determine which reference record is most likely
    the same person as the sample laureate record.
    """
    handler = dspy.Predict(EntityHandler)
    result = await handler.acall(sample=sample, reference_records=reference_records)
    return result.output, result.confidence
```

The above snippet defines an async function, and involves just a couple of lines changed from
the regular sync Python function. You simply instantiate the built-in DSPy `Predict` module and pass in
the `Signature` object that we defined earlier. The `acall` method is used to call the module asynchronously,
and you can await results in an async context.

### 💡 What does DSPy's generated prompt look like?

It's worth taking a moment to understand what DSPy actually _does_ to help the user avoid writing manual prompts
by hand. Under the hood, the DSPy `Module` uses an [`Adapter`](https://dspy.ai/learn/programming/overview)
that takes the `Signature` and the input data,
and applies the information from the type system of the language (in this case, Python) to generate a prompt
that looks something like the example below. On the left is the signature and module declaration,
and on the right are the system and user messages that DSPy generates as part of the prompt for the LLM.

<img src="/img/intro-to-dspy-data-enrichment/generated-prompt.png" alt="DSPy-generated prompt" />

You can always inspect the generated prompts by calling the `dspy.inspect_history()` function.
If you're interested, see a more readable version of the
generated prompt [here](https://gist.github.com/prrao87/56192a8b6ac6678a8983b161d1d43074).

#### Run the DSPy pipeline

Now that we've defined the LLM, types, signature, and module, the next step is to run the DSPy pipeline
end-to-end and return a mapping of IDs between the two datasets.
To collect the most similar reference records for each scholar in the primary dataset,
we can use the following vector search query function in Kuzu and from the result, coerce each
object to the `Reference` Pydantic type defined above.

```py
def get_similar_records(
    conn: kuzu.Connection, vector: list[float], topk: int = 3
) -> list[Reference]:
    """
    Get top-k most similar reference records via vector search.
    """
    result = conn.execute(
        f"""
        CALL QUERY_VECTOR_INDEX(
            '{table_name}',
            '{index_name}',
            $query_vector,
            $limit
        )
        RETURN node.id AS id, node.knownName AS knownName, node.fullName AS fullName, node.category AS category, node.awardYear AS year
        ORDER BY distance;
        """,
        {"query_vector": query_vector, "limit": topk},
    ).get_as_pl()
    result = result.select("id", "knownName", "fullName", "category", "year")
    # Below, we randomly shuffle to ensure that the LLM's reasoning ability is exercised
    # If we don't shuffle, the correct answer will likely always be the first in the list
    # because that's what vector search returns
    result = result.sample(n=len(result), shuffle=True)
    return [Reference(**row) for row in result.to_dicts()]
```

Note how we randomly shuffle the results to actually convince ourselves that the LLM is reasoning about the
context and not just returning the first result as the answer every time.
The full code that runs the DSPy module after vector search is available
[here](https://github.com/kuzudb/dspy-kuzu-demo/blob/main/s2_dspy_workflow.py).

The output from our DSPy pipeline is a list of records that looks like this:

```json
[
  {
    "source": {
      "name": "George Smith",
      "category": "Chemistry",
      "year": "2018"
    },
    "matched_record": {
      "id": 964,
      "knownName": "George P. Smith",
      "fullName": "George P. Smith",
      "category": "Chemistry"
    },
    "confidence": "high"
  },
  ...
]
```
We now have a mapping of the name from the primary dataset to the `id` of the matched record in the secondary dataset!
For this simple use case, 100% of all the records returned were matched with a "high" confidence level, which is
great. However, in other scenarios, you may find that the LLM returns a "low" confidence level for some records,
so it's worth inspecting those cases more deeply to see if the context provided to the LLM is sufficient for it to
make a judgment.

### Create final graph in Kuzu

The mapped objects from above are then used to merge the two datasets, allowing us to then create a unified graph that incorporates
all the information about laureates and their mentorship relationships. The graph
[is created](https://github.com/kuzudb/dspy-kuzu-demo/blob/main/s4_create_graph.py) using a combination
of Polars DataFrames and Pydantic, and persisted to a Kuzu database. The schema of this graph contains
the following nodes and relationships:

<img src="/img/intro-to-dspy-data-enrichment/nobel-schema.png" alt="Graph schema for Nobel laureate mentorship network" width="700" />

Below, we show a visualization
of the full graph in G.V()[^6], where you can conveniently size the nodes by their out-degree (number of children) --
larger nodes indicate that the scholar mentored more people. The image shows that many of these scholars
in the early 20th century had an influence across multiple disciplines, with the physics, chemistry, and medicine
clusters sharing many common connections. The economics clusters are more isolated, which makes sense because the
field is relatively recent, and is more or less distinct from the pure sciences.

<img src="/img/intro-to-dspy-data-enrichment/mentorship-graph.png" alt="Nobel laureate mentorship network with clusters" />

### Cost implications

Below, we summarize some key numbers from the DSPy and graph construction pipeline.

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Cost of end-to-end-DSPy pipeline | $0.07 |
| Run time of DSPy (async) pipeline | < 1 minute |
| No. of unique laureates | 655 |
| No. of mentorship relationships | 5,713 |
| No. of scholars (with or without Nobel prizes) | 2,726 |
| No. of Nobel prizes (awarded between 1901-2021) | 739 |
| No. of institutions | 345 |
| No. of cities | 194 |
| No. of countries | 57 |
| No. of continents | 6 |

For a mid-tier LLM like `google/gemini-2.0-flash`, the cost of running the DSPy pipeline
is less than 10 cents, and the entire pipeline runs in under a minute. The takeaway is this:
As LLMs continue to improve and
become faster and cheaper at the same time, it's increasingly feasible to use them for
tasks like this that may have previously required combining supervised machine learning and
rule-based approaches. Of course, the more widespread the use of LLMs becomes, the more important
the evaluation governance and safety aspects also become, but that's a topic for another day.

## Analyze the graph

With the entire data stored in Kuzu, we can now run Cypher queries to answer some interesting questions!

> "How many Nobel laureates were descendants of Lord Rayleigh?"

```cypher
// Lord Rayleigh has the id "l8" after data merging
// We run a recursive Cypher query using the Kleene star operator
MATCH (a:Scholar)-[:MENTORED*]->(b)
WHERE a.id = "l8"
AND b.scholar_type = "scholar"
RETURN count(DISTINCT b) AS num_descendants
```

| value | value |
| --- | --- |
| num_descendants | 249 |

Lord Rayleigh[^3], one of the earliest Physics laureates, has a whopping 249 descendants who
are themselves Nobel laureates! This implies that there are very dense interconnected clusters
among the early Physics laureates.

> Who are the female Chemistry Nobel laureates affiliated with non-US institutions?

```cypher
// Multi-predicate, multi-path finding query 
MATCH (s:Scholar)-[:WON]->(p:Prize),
      (s)-[:AFFILIATED_WITH]->(i:Institution)-[:IS_LOCATED_IN]->(city:City)-[:IS_CITY_IN]->(country:Country)
WHERE s.scholar_type = "laureate"
AND s.gender = "female"
AND p.category = "chemistry"
AND country.name <> "USA"
RETURN DISTINCT s.knownName, city.name, country.name, i.name
```

| s.knownName              | city.name | country.name     | i.name                                   |
|--------------------------|-----------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Ada E. Yonath           | Rehovot   | Israel           | Weizmann Institute of Science           |
| Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin| Oxford    | United Kingdom   | University of Oxford, Royal Society     |
| Emmanuelle Charpentier  | Berlin    | Germany          | Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens |
| Marie Curie             | Paris     | France           | Sorbonne University                     |

There were four female laureates in Chemistry who were affiliated with non-US institutions -- this is
a question that required the enriched data to answer appropriately.

A lot more queries that combine insights from scholars, prizes and the institutions, cities, and countries
they are affiliated with can be run in this manner. We'll leave a more detailed exploration that uses
graph algorithms and more, for a future post.

## Conclusions

In this post, we discussed the task of data enrichment, and how it can be reformulated as a two-stage
process involving vector search and LLM-as-a-judge for entity disambiguation. We introduced DSPy,
a declarative AI framework, and showed how it can be easily plugged
into existing data and LLM pipelines. In just a few lines of code, we were able to concisely
incorporate DSPy's core primitives into our pipeline, without writing a single prompt by hand.
This opens up a powerful new way to work with LLMs, where you can focus on describing your _intent_
rather getting caught up in the intricate details of how to properly phrase the prompt.

Of course, we could just as well have worked with LLMs using any other framework (e.g., BAML, as
we've shown in an [earlier post](/post/unstructured-data-to-graph-baml-kuzu), or a raw LLM API call).
However, the methodology we presented (and the reason we chose DSPy) is because
it's actually quite general-purpose and flexible enough
to be applied in several other domains and tasks. It's also scalable from a cost and performance perspective,
because transforming a DSPy pipeline from sync to async involves just a few lines of code changes, and
the vector search functionality in Kuzu can provide near-instantaneous retrieval results on very large datasets.

The approach shown here just scratches the surface of what's possible with DSPy. In future posts, we'll
explore more advanced use cases, defining custom DSPy modules and adapters, plus adding  evaluations
and optimizers for graph-related tasks like Text2Cypher, information extraction, and more. Hopefully, this post got
you curious to learn more.

[_How to win a Nobel Prize_](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-024-02897-2/index.html)
for an interesting exploration of a similar nature (pun intended).

[^3]: You may remember the name "Lord Rayleigh" from high school physics -- he provided an explanation of
the scattering of light that causes the sky to appear blue -- but his real name was John William Strutt.
Lord Rayleigh was his _title_ and not his name. If you look at the interactive results from footnote #2
(the Nature article), you'll see that Lord Rayleigh trained only one laureate himself (J.J. Thomson),
but J.J. Thomson, with 11 laureates as his descendants, _really_ got the tree going. This led
to a total of 200+ descendants originating from the tree with Rayleigh as the root node.
These kinds of queries can be asked very naturally and easily in Cypher, the query language of Kuzu.

[^4]: As in many other scenarios, an LLM's outputs are probabilistic in nature. So for mission-critical
applications, you may want to have a human-in-the-loop or use a dedicated SDK like [Senzing](https://senzing.com/senzing-sdk)
to handle entity disambiguation and resolution tasks. It's always important to do adequate
due diligence, testing and evals before deploying any LLM-based pipeline in production.

[^5]: You can also use the `dspy.ChainOfThought` module in case you're using a smaller model or
the task is slightly more complex. Allowing the model to reason over its chain of thought can
significantly improve the quality of the output, but it also takes longer and requires more tokens.

[^6]: All graphs visualizations in this post are done using G.V(), a visualization tool for graphs
that seamlessly connects to Kuzu databases. The nice thing about using G.V() is that you
can easily display _the entire graph_ in one go -- it can easily handle up to thousands
of nodes and tens of thousands of edges without any performance issues.
This is thanks to its [WebGL-powered](https://gdotv.com/blog/neo4j-graph-database-browser-vs-gdotv/) rendering engine,
which makes much more efficient use of your device's computing power than traditional graph
visualization tools that use SVG or Canvas.
